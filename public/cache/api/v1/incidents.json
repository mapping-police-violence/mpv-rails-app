Ultimately, eight officers and sergeants arrived at the scene. They used two sets of handcuffs on Moore and a wrap device to restrain her leg movement, according to the internal investigation. Finally, after five to 10 minutes of struggling on the mattress, Moore stopped resisting. Soon after, officers realized Moore’s chest had stopped moving. Officers moved Moore from being partially on her stomach to completely on her side. About a minute later, officers observed she was no longer breathing and had no pulse, according to the internal investigation. One officer began chest compressions, while another kept Moore’s airway open and called for a CPR mask, which provides a protective barrier and makes mouth-to-mouth resuscitation more efficient.","official_disposition_of_death":"Found Excusable","criminal_charges":"No Known Charges","news_url":"http://www.dailycal.org/2014/05/07/leaked-documents-shed-new-light-kayla-moore-death/","mental_illness":"Yes","unarmed":"Unarmed","line_of_duty":"Line of Duty","note":null,"in_custody":null,"arrest_related_death":null,"unique_mpv":123,"created_at":"2015-08-22T04:02:34.149Z","updated_at":"2015-08-22T04:02:34.149Z","latitude":"37.8664","longitude":"-122.257"},{"id":782,"victim_name":"Rumain Brisbon","victim_age":34,"victim_gender":"Male","victim_race":"Black","victim_image_url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71e0cd988bb75a05f05e8307598e50b8f9bace51/c=0-0-360-480\u0026r=537\u0026c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/12/04/635532944352170263-Rumain-Brisbon-w-child.jpg","incident_date":"2014-02-12","incident_street_address":"15400 North 25th Avenue","incident_city":"Phoenix","incident_state":"AZ","incident_zip":"85023","incident_county":"Maricopa","agency_responsible":"Phoenix Police Department","cause_of_death":"Gunshot","alleged_victim_crime":"N, Burglary","crime_category":"Property Crime; No Gun","aggregate_crime_category":"Criminal Suspect with No Gun","caveat":null,"solution":null,"incident_description":"Police looking for a burglary suspect approached Brisbon.
