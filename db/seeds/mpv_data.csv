They claimed Bradford, who was riding a bike without a helmet, was in the alley and reaching into a car “occupied by unknown individuals.” When they went to confront him, Burgess took off on his bicycle. Puckett gave chase on foot; Burgess, in his squad car. Eventually, that case took them to the 3100 block the Julius Schepps Freeway, where Burgess and Puckett insisted Bradford turned into the squad car. But that was not the case. Investigators eventually determined that Burgess ran over Bradford — then failed to call for an ambulance for several minutes, doing so only when Bradford began complaining about his injuries. Police also determined that the officers moved the squad car, Bradford and his bike, and told paramedics that someone else had hit the 51-year-old.
